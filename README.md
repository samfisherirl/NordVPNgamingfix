# NordVPNgamingfix
Fixes online gaming for Forza, PGA Tour hb-ne 3101, Battlefield 4, and more. 

This application is designed for Pausing NordVPN when playing specific online games that conflict with NORDVPN. I would always forget to turn back on Nord. This app automatically reconnects to the VPN upon the game closing. 

I have spent 5 days working on this, the read me is sparse. There may be a bug or two, and there may be more popup messages from my own troubleshooting. I will return tomorrow morning with a full read me, and address any bugs.
